# School_District_Analysis 

The following project was to analyze standardized testing data from a city school district to find any performance trends and patterns. 

## Report Findings 

### Preparing the Data 
After our data set was imported, it was discovered we had missing and duplicated data. We started by removing these rows. One of the columns also had integers with text. We removed the text so we could better analyze that column. 

To see what data we were working with we summarized this data using the describe function. This told us we were working with 14,831 rows of data. From this summary we could already determine that overall students scored higher in reading than they did in math. 

### Drilling Into the Data 
When drilling down into the data we showed the grade column and summarized the 9th grade statistics. We found that the minimum reading score was 10.5 which was from a 10th grader at Dixon High School, a charter school. We then selected all 10th graders at Dixon High School and viewed their reading scores. Furthermore, we looked at the average reading score for all students in grades 11 and 12 combined which was a score of 74.9. 

### Comparing the Data 
Lastly we compared different data sets. We looked at the average budget for charter schools versus public schools. This showed that public schools have over a 4% higher budget than charter schools. We compared all high schools and the total number of students they have and sorted them so we could easily see who had the highest versus lowest student counts. Then we looked at each grades math score in the public versus charter school. In grades 9, 10 and 11, the math scores were higher are the charter school. 

## Additional Analysis 
We could conduct further analysis for the school district to dig deeper into this data. To name a few, we could look at each schools budget and compare math and reading scores, we could look at reading scores in each grade and compare to school types or we could rank each school based on scores for math, reading or both. There is a lot more data and comparisons that could be pulled from here if desired.
